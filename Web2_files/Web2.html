					<li class="mmessage">The old man and the sea
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had
						gone
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">eighty- four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had
						been with him.
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old
						man was
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the
						boy had gone
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It
						made the
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always
						went
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the
						sail that
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled,
						it looked
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">like the flag of permanent defeat.
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9]
						reflection on the
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face
						and his
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">hands had the deep- creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But
						none of
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as
						the
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"Santiago," the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff
						was
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">hauled up. "I could go with you again. We've made some money."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"No," the old man said. "You're with a lucky boat. Stay with them."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"But remember how you went eighty- seven days without fish and then we caught
						big
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">ones every day for three weeks."

					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"I remember/' the old man said. "I know you did not leave me because you
						doubted."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"I know/' the old man said. "It is quite normal."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"He hasn't much faith."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">[ 10] "No/' the old man said. "But we have. Haven't we?"
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">'Yes/' the boy said. "Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we'll take
						the stuff
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">home."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"Why not?" the old man said. "Between fishermen."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and
						he
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">was noteangry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But
						they did
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had
						drifted
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The
						successful
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and
						carried
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of
						each plank,
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the
						market in
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the
						other
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers
						removed, their
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for
						salting.
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">factory; but today there [11] was only the faint edge of the odour because the
						wind had
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the
						Terrace.
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"Santiago," the boy said.
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">'Yes," the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years
						ago.
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?"
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some
						way."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">'You bought me a beer," the old man said. 'You are already a man."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"How old was I when you first took me in a boat?"
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the frsh in too green and he
						nearly
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?"
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the
						wet coiled
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him
						like
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">[ 12] "Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?"

					<li class="mmessage">The Old Man and the Sea
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">Asiaing.com
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"I remember everything from when we first went together."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">The old man looked at him with his sun- burned, confident loving eyes.
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"If you were my boy I'd take you out and gamble/' he said. "But you are your
						father's
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">and your mother's and you are in a lucky boat."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"Let me get four fresh ones."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"One," the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now
						they
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">were freshening as when the breeze rises.
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">'Two/' the boy said.
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">'Two/' the old man agreed. 'You didn't steal them?"
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"I would," the boy said. "But I bought these."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"Thank you," the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">humility. But he [ 13] knew he had attained it and he knew it was not
						disgraceful and it
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">carried no loss of true pride.
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">'Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current," he said.
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"Where are you going?" the boy asked.
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"I'll try to get him to work far out," the boy said. "Then if you hook
						something truly
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">big we can come to your aid."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"He does not like to work too far out."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"No," the boy said. "But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">working and get
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">him to come out after dolphin." "Are his eyes that bad?" 'He is almost blind."
						"It is
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">strange," the old man said. "He never went turtle- ing. That is what kills the
						eyes." "But
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">you went turtle- ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"I am a strange old man"
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?"
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">"I think so. And there are many tricks."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">[14] "Let us take the stuff home," the boy said. "So I can get the cast net and
						go after
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">the sardines."
					</li>
					<li class="mmessage">They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his
						shoulder
